# RUBRIC for the Assignment

## 5 points:

* Your correct and complete GitHub URL is submitted in Canvas by the deadline.

* Your repo contains the forked contents of the original repo PLUS a new branch.

* The new branch is named *assignment-yourname* (*yourname* will be your last name).

* Inside the new branch are two (2) new files with the correct filenames, as described here: https://github.com/macloo/CSS-intro-with-GitHub/tree/master/assignment

(All criteria must be met to get 5 points.)

## 10 points:

All of the above.

Plus, ALL CRITERIA HERE are met: https://github.com/macloo/CSS-intro-with-GitHub/tree/master/assignment

**Note:** I expect to see all five *pseudo classes* specified separately AND in the correct order. Find these things (the five, and the order) in your book. You may repeat a color for some classes and/or use one or two additional colors outside your palette for links if necessary.

(All criteria must be met to get 10 points.)

## 15 points:

All of the above. Plus:

* Your colors demonstrate a careful selection of colors that look good together.

* All hexadecimal RGB codes are used correctly (no color names are used).

* All punctuation marks and symbols required in the CSS file are used correctly.

* The CSS and HTML are formatted neatly. Use linespaces and indents like a professional so the code is easy to read.

* The five pseudo classes are specified absolutely correctly (see Robbins) in the CSS file.

* All text, including all links, has good contrast against the background color, regardless of which element contains it.

* You could show your final HTML and CSS files to anyone, not just your instructor.

(All criteria must be met to get 15 points.)

## DISHONESTY

Showing your code to any other student, or giving another student code to solve the problem, or any part of the problem, is a violation of the university's honor code. Asking for a solution in any online forum is a violation of the university's honor code. Copying code from another student, past or present, is a violation of the university's honor code. Allowing anyone else to write code for you is a violation of the university's honor code. You must do your own work, or risk a failing grade for the entire course. Penalties for academic dishonesty are spelled out in the syllabus for this course.
